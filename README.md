I'm a 2nd-year BCA student deeply passionate about full-stack web development, system design, and emerging technologies like Web 3.0. I'm continuously learning and building real-world projects to sharpen my skills and explore how technology can solve everyday problems.

I work primarily with **React.js**, **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **PostgreSQL**. I'm also experienced with **Tailwind CSS**, **GraphQL**, **WebSockets**, **NextAuth**, and more. Currently exploring **Recoil** for state management and diving into **cloud platforms** and **advanced DSA**.

I'm on a mission to become a top-tier software developer, and I'm preparing actively for placements. Always open to feedback, collaboration, and cool ideas!
